      "Q1. An ensemble technique in machine learning is a method that combines predictions from multiple individual models (often referred to as base models or weak learners) to produce a more accurate and robust prediction. The goal of ensemble techniques is to leverage the diversity of these base models to improve the overall performance and generalization of the model.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q2. Ensemble techniques are used in machine learning for several reasons:\n",
      "\n",
      "They can reduce overfitting by combining multiple models that may have different sources of error.\n",
      "They often lead to improved prediction accuracy compared to single models.\n",
      "They are robust to noisy data and outliers because they can aggregate information from multiple sources.\n",
      "They can handle complex relationships in data by using various modeling approaches.\n",
      "They are versatile and can be applied to various machine learning algorithms and tasks.\n",
      "Q3. Bagging, which stands for Bootstrap Aggregating, is an ensemble technique in machine learning. It involves training multiple instances of the same base model on different subsets of the training data, where each subset is created by random sampling with replacement (bootstrap samples). The final prediction is usually obtained by averaging (for regression) or voting (for classification) the predictions of these individual models.\n",
      "\n",
      "Q4. Boosting is another ensemble technique that aims to improve the performance of weak learners by training them sequentially. It assigns different weights to each training instance, and in each iteration, it gives more weight to the instances that were misclassified in the previous iteration. This process continues until a predefined number of iterations is reached or until the model performs well. AdaBoost and Gradient Boosting are examples of boosting algorithms.\n",

      "Improved predictive performance.\n",
      "Reduced overfitting and increased model generalization.\n",
      "Increased robustness to noisy data and outliers.\n",
      "Enhanced model stability.\n",
      "The ability to capture complex relationships in data.\n",
      "Flexibility to combine different types of base models for diverse datasets.\n",
      "Q6. Ensemble techniques are not always better than individual models. The effectiveness of ensemble methods depends on factors such as the quality of the base models, the diversity among those models, and the nature of the data. In some cases, a single well-tuned model may outperform an ensemble. Ensemble techniques are particularly useful when there is a variety of base models to combine, and they often shine in complex and noisy datasets.\n",

      "Calculate the statistic of interest (e.g., mean) for this bootstrap sample.\n",
      "Repeat steps 1 and 2 a large number of times (typically thousands of times) to create a distribution of the statistic.\n",
